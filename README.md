# ColorWheel
Color selection interface designed in pure JQuery (Javascript) &amp; CSS.

## Description
The methodology behind this project places heavy dependence on Javascript/JQuery to create the desired affect. The consequence of this is that there isn't much reliance on HTML to create a color wheel. The API supports placement of multiple colorwheels within a page.

## Usage
To create a color wheel, pick the desired location of the wheel in the HTML document and create a new <div> with a class value of "colorwheel" like so.
  
```HTML
<div class="colorwheel"></div>
```
